Several scripts are available to ease the generation of client / server certificates so as to running client / server commands for testing purpose with gdb.

# run.sh

## run_vuln_server

This is the main command that can bootstrap all the environment.

```run.sh run_vuln_server```

1. Fetch OpenSSL source code, statically compile it with debug symbols. It also adds CFLAGS to generate expand files, useful to generate call graph.
2. Build server certificate chains
3. Build client certificate chains
4. start server gdb session with previously openssl binary compiled at step1. Gdb commands will:
  * set a breakpoint on the vulnerable function
  * run the server command

Finally as displayed in the script, you just need to trigger the server's vulnerable function with the following command:

```
cd client && ./run_client.sh
```

## compile

```run.sh compile```

Fetches OpenSSL source code, statically compiles it with debug symbols. It also adds CFLAGS to generate expand files, useful to generate call graph.

## build_client

```run.sh build_client```

Rebuilds the client certificate chains. Useful if you updated the client configuration and just want to use the new certs.

## build_server

```run.sh build_server```

Behaves like the previous command but server related.

## clean / clean_server / clean_client

```run.sh clean```

These commands will delete all files created at build step. You can clean globally by calling clean, or just for server with clean_server, just for client with clean_client
