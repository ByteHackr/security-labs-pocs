# Contributing

This repository is maintained by Datadog Security Labs.  Primary contributions will only be made internally but we do accept pull requests for enhancements, documentation fixes, etc.

## Datadog Contributions of New Code

1. Add your code to the `proof-of-concept-exploits` directory
2. Update the listing of exploits in the README.md 
3. Add any 3rd party licenses to the LICENSE-3rdparty.csv file

> All proof of concepts added should include a README with instructions on how to demonstrate the exploit or demo script.  A Makefile is reccomended for ease of use and highly encouraged.  Example: `make run-exploit`
